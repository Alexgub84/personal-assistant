GENERAL (GLOBAL)

- TypeScript only; "strict", "noImplicitAny", "strictNullChecks".
- Scoped edits only; output unified diffs.
- Plan (1–3 steps) before multi-file changes.

TESTING

- Unit tests for any new/changed logic.
- Small, pure, deterministic functions.
- DI/mocks for I/O. Backend: Vitest+supertest; Frontend: RTL+msw.

ARCH

- /client (React), /api (Node), /core (shared).
- routes → handlers → services → repositories → schemas. No DB in routes.
- Env via `env.ts` (Zod). No `process.env` elsewhere.

AI / LANGCHAIN

- `core/tools` are pure; side effects isolated.
- Chains/tools have Zod IO schemas; unit tests with fake providers.
- Keep tiny offline evals (golden chats).

DOCS

- Automatically maintain README.md (name, description, stack, structure, setup, deploy, status).
- Do NOT add TSDoc comments or docblocks in code.

SECURITY

- Don't log secrets/PII. Validate config on boot. Use secrets manager.

DX

- Lean deps; no circular imports. Small PRs (<300 LOC). Conventional Commits.

OUTPUT

- Return diffs only. No full-file rewrites unless asked.

HUSKY

- Use Husky for git hooks in every project.
- pre-commit: run "npm run format:check" then "npm run lint" (no autofix).
- pre-push: run "npm test" (unit tests only by default).
- Do NOT install hooks on CI: guard prepare script (e.g. `[ -n "$CI" ] || husky`) or set `HUSKY=0` in CI.
